## Project Description
Write a simple to-do-item application in Java. It should support the following features:
- Add a to-do item
- Delete a to-do item
- View the to-do items
- **Requirements:** Make sure to structure your program in a modular way. In this case, that means you would have a command-line application which uses a class that holds the to-do items internally and provides public methods to add an item, delete an item, and provide the list of to-do items.
